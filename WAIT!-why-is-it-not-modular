I am giving away the old mono code base-
The code is modular now - here. at my place. I spent 6 months:
- refactoring the code to be modular
- debugging
- improving
- getting ready for phase II - detailed in my book

Will I ever give away the new, improved code?
- which features a backend watchdog?

That is the commercial version...So no
