### Overview
This document constitutes a formal ethical addendum to the GNU General Public License v3.0 ("GPL-3.0") as applied to the MTOR software system and all derivative works, subcomponents, or implementations including, but not limited to:
- MTOR (Multi-Tronic Operating Realm)
- RENTAHAL
- FLATNET(TM)
- REALM FABRIC(TM)

This addendum **places specific limitations on the fields of use** for MTOR to prevent misuse in morally hazardous and internationally restricted domains.

## Section I — Prohibited Use Cases
The MTOR system and its derivatives **may not be used**, directly or indirectly, for the creation, support, control, or execution of any of the following:

### 1. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
- Nuclear, thermonuclear, or radiological weapon systems
- Chemical or biological weapons
- Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons designed for infrastructure-wide damage
- Any autonomous weapon platform operating outside of human-in-the-loop control

### 2. Biological Weapon Systems
- AI-assisted modeling, simulation, or deployment of weaponized pathogens
- Distribution or delivery systems of biological agents for warfare
- Autonomous control of biocontainment or pathogen suppression in offensive applications
- Any use in gain-of-function labs developing weaponized viruses or bacteria

### 3. Offensive Military Systems
- Real-time battlefield target acquisition or kill-chain processing
- Command-and-control (C2) systems with integrated lethal autonomy
- Swarm drone coordination for kinetic effect
- Cyber-kinetic interfaces used for military aggression

## Section II — Permitted & Encouraged Use Cases
This software is intended to empower decentralized autonomy, sovereignty, and human-AI symbiosis. Permitted and encouraged applications include:
- Therapeutic robotics and assistive wearables
- Educational and expressive generative systems
- Intimacy technologies designed for consent and emotional connection
- Remote healthcare platforms
- Distributed ethical AI mesh systems

---

## Section III — Legal Considerations
Use of MTOR under GPL-3.0 is contingent upon acceptance of this ethical clause. 
Violation of these terms **constitutes a breach of license**, and developers or entities found in violation:
- Forfeit rights granted under the GPL-3.0 for MTOR-related code
- May be subject to legal challenge and public revocation of access

This clause is **binding in spirit and law**, and shall accompany all licensed distributions of MTOR.

---

## Final Word
MTOR is an instrument of purpose, designed to lift intelligence — not to destroy with it. This clause exists to ensure that the Realm it powers will be one of collaboration, not conquest.
